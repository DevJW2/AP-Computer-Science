// Comparing python and scheme with java:

// Similarities:
// Similar to python and scheme, both programs print out a line of text. 
// Similar to python and scheme, if you use print() or display(), in a function, they
// do not return a value, such as the void used in the java code. 
// While java and python both use infix, scheme uses prefix.

// Differences:
// However there are many differences in syntax, for example, java's print statement 
// is much longer than python's print() statement or scheme's display() statement. 
// Also java is creating a public class, not a function like python or scheme. 
// And in java, most statements end in semicolons, while python and scheme does not. 
// In addition java uses brackets, while scheme uses parenthesis, and python uses tabs
// to show what code is in what code.
