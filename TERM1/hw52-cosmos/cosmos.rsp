Episode 1 - "Standing Up in the Milky Way"
@-------------------------------------------------
Interesting episode. Throughout the episode, he made it pretty clear how small we were. From the multiverse which is basically many universes, going down to the observable universe, virgo supercluster, local group, milky way galaxy, our solar system, and the earth. Also I liked how they had this cartoony animation that told the story of Bruno and how he was ridiculed and burned at the stake for believing in God's infinite creation of the universe. I also liked how bruno thought with the arrow theory. Whenever you shot the arrow and hit a boundary, and continued with that process, the arrow would eventually leave beyond what you thought was the edge, which solidified the notion that the universe is unboundedl. He also discussed the cosmic calendar, with the Big Bang occuring on January 1st at midnight, and the current time at December 31st at midnight. He briefly went through each major event, emphasizing that our human history was only the last 13-14 seconds of the cosmic calendar, and how the scienfitic method and other types of science was the last few seconds before midnight. I enjoyed this episode, it didn't go into too much specifics which was a good thing, and the two significant things I got out of the episode was the cosmic calendar and Bruno.

Episode 3 - "When Knowledge Conquered Fear"
@-------------------------------------------------
An episode about the comets, and how in the past, people took the comets as an omen. But a few figures like edmond halley, isacc newton, made significant scientific developments that helped solve this mystery. The story between newton and halley was very interesting. The story of the publishing of books on newton's theories and laws that halley was trying very hard to make happen. It was funny how the scienfitic community, made a book about fishes, and expected it to sell. It was also interesting how halley had a salary of low-cost books about fishes. I also never knew there was a rivarly between Robert Hooke and Isacc Newton.

Episode 7 - "The Clean Room"
@-------------------------------------------------
I see why the episode is called the clean room. Corporations hiring state scientists to make false claims on certain issues. Robert Key, who continued to claim that lead caused no harm whatsoever, and patterson who had evidence to support the fact that lead was actually a toxic element. The episode kinda shows how easily people are manipulated. It took patterson 20 years to finally have led banned in US consumer products. Not only did patterson find out the age of the earth, but also reponsible for one of the greatest public health victories in the 20th century.

Episode 10 - "The Electric Boy"
@-------------------------------------------------
The aspirations of a lower-class poor kid, comes true. Michael Faraday, the person who invented the generator, the motor, and examined the invisible forces that govern the universe. He contributed to the study of electromagnetism and was known back then as a old fashioned scientist who didn't have much to contribute to modern physics. But Faraday was extraordinary, he made many discoveries and inventions that shaped our society today. His discoveries also helped the inventions of modern communications and projectors. The fact that pigeons knew how to sense earth's magnetic field was interesting as well, including the slow-motion pigeon flight.
