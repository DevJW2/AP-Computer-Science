Knight’s Tour Algorithm

1) Place knight in the first column in the chess board 
2) Generate positions that the knight can go
3) If there’s no open position, go to another position in the same column and delete the past knight 
Or, backtrack and delete the past placed knight and go to a new position
4) Recursively make the knight travel to an open position
5) Make open position into unplaceable position after landing
6) Repeat: start at step 2
